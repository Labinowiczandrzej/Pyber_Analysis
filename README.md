# Pyber_Analysis
## PyBer Summary and Analysis
-The purpose of this assignment was to take data from the company Pyber and compare it based on the 3 types of cities. The types were separated into Urban, Rural, and Suburban. I was given date about fare, drivers, and rides to compare between the city types. Using my knowledge of Python, Pandas, and Matplots. I made a visual representation and dataframes of the data to be able to an answer questions posed by the CEO on what and why are we looking at.

-For figure one we are using a bubble chart to compare the total number of rides and the average fare. At the same time, you can see that the size of the bubbles is changing based of the amount of drivers in the area. You can see that the average fare is higher in rural areas, but the number of drivers is lower. Especially in comparison to the urban and suburban areas.

Fig 2 we are using box and whisker plots to compare the number of rides and the city types. The box and whisker plots give us the quartiles, max, min, and mean to compare. The visual above shows us that with urban cities not only is the average number of rides higher, but also the spread from max to min is more than the other city types. Meaning suburban and rural cities. Not making any deductions but you can see the spread shrink to suburban cities and shrink even more down to rural. The average drops as well.

The figure above is now comparing fares and city types the same way we compared with the bubble chart in the beginning. This way you can see the means are very comparable (urban-25, suburban=30, rural=37) Rural has higher fares in all counts other than the 1st quartile and minimum. Suburban cities have a higher 1st quartile and minimum than rural. While Urban cities are last in all counts.

Now we are using box and whisker plots to compare the statistics for the 3 city types while comparing driver count and city types. When looking at overall spread the largest range, difference of max and min, belongs to the urban cities, suburban after that. The smallest range belongs to the rural cities. The average amount of drivers follow the same kind of pattern as you can see with the mean line in red on the box and whisker plot.

Transitioning from the box and whisker we are going to use a pie chart to look at the percentage of overall fares. This visual makes it a lot easier to see how much revenue Urban is pulling in compared to the other two types. You can add up rural and suburban together and Urban is still controlling a larger part of the total fares.

Changing from fares to percentage of rides you can see that the same relationship as I was just discussing, but even more so than before. So Even though they have 68% of the total rides, urban is only bringing in 62% of the total fare.

Making matters worse is that 62% of the total fare is being spread over almost 81% of the total drivers. As is shown in the above pie chart. The other types have a better distribution of funds. Rural has 6.8% of the total fare being spread among 2.6% of the drivers while suburban is bringing in 30% of the total fare while only having to divide that among 16.5% of the drivers. This gives evidence, but not concrete proof, that drivers in urban cities will have to work harder to make the money the rural drivers do. There can be some factors that come into play here.

# SUMMARY
 
Based on this analysis, my three recommendations for the CEO of Pyber would address one the different total fare percentage, two the amount of drivers, and finally the average fare per driver. I wouldnâ€™t recommend that the CEO cuts drivers in the urban areas. There are more rides in these areas plus a higher population. To address the total percentage of the percentage disparity. I would find ways to hire on more drivers in the rural areas. This way not only could you have the possibility of more rides, but even out the fare per drivers as well. Looking at the data you can see that there are spikes in late February and April. Have an incentive to bring in more drivers for those times as more will be needed. This addresses all the issues at once.
	My second recommendation would be to increase the fare in urban areas. This would help with the fare to driver rate in the city and at the same time cut back on the number of rides without completely hurting the revenue stream. The combo of which would help drivers make more per trip. 
Lastly there would need to be more research into where the most popular ride picks up are or even times when customers ride for longer. This information would help strategically place drivers in position to pick up larger fares and more customers. We do not have this data in this project, but it is my opinion that this would be beneficial for the average fares between the different types of cities.
